# A-Better-Pig
My attempt to have "Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs" make sense.

## Rationale
Some folks like "Machine for Pigs", and that's fine. But I feel that the writing is too opaque, the story too convoluted to call it "good". In short, the game makes zero sense.

## Writing Style
I get it: Victorian prose was flowery, full of innuendo, euphemism and so forth. But this is a game created for *modern players*. One shouldn't need a PhD in English Lit to appreciate it!

And so I shall try and make the writing in "A Better Pig" clearer, with less florid phrases and more actual information.

## Interactivity
It's no secret that a lot of AMFP's interactions were stripped back...streamlined, if you like...compared to the original *Amnesia*. Furniture and doors are now static; the inventory was chopped out; etc. Perhaps most henous of all: you can now escape monsters simply by running down a long hallway! How boring.

And so my other goal is liven things up: opening doors, making monsters harder to lose, etc. Ultimately the game should feel more like a *game*, less like a ride at Disney World.

# Implementation
Right now, it's undecided which engine I shall use, but here are a few thoughts.

## HPL2 (Dark Descent)


## HPL3 (Rebirth)
Has an inventory again! Also nice features such as reminders. Would need to find an artist.
Level Edtior shows an object's coordinates. Nice; wish it was in the others too.

## HPL3 (SOMA)
More streamlined; has a large variety of monsters (which can be re-skinned).
Would need to re-impliment notes and diaries; more work.
